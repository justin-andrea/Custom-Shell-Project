Built a simple command line shell similar to shells commonly used in UNIX and Linux OSes (e.g. tcsh or bash). The shell accepts typed instructions and either responds directly or runs programs as specified by the user. When the command entered is a program, the shell will fork a new process, invoke the external command, and then wait for the command to finish.
